            <p class="page-subtitle">Built for people who value simplicity and clarity</p>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>DoNext was created from a simple belief: productivity should feel effortless. Too many tools compete for attention, layering complexity where clarity is needed most.</p>
                <p>We designed DoNext to be different. Every detail is intentional. Every interaction is quiet, fast, and predictable. The interface doesn’t demand focus, it preserves it.</p>
                <p>This is a space built for thinking clearly and acting deliberately.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>DoNext is shaped by a few core principles.</p>
                <ul class="philosophy-list">
                    <li><strong>Less, but Better:</strong><br> Features exist only when they meaningfully improve the experience. Nothing is added without purpose. </li>
                    <li><strong>Design That Disappears:</strong><br> A refined interface reduces mental noise. When design is done right, it fades into the background and lets your work take center stage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect for Time:</strong><br> Instant response. No friction. No learning curve. DoNext is ready the moment you are.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Built With Intention</h2>
                <p>DoNext is crafted using modern web technologies to deliver a smooth, consistent experience across devices. 
                     <br> Your tasks are stored locally in your browser private by default. We don’t collect, track, or store your data.
                     <br> <br> Because productivity works best when trust is absolute.</p>
